# Requirements Traceability Matrix

> **Provenance**: first written on 2026-09-14 as `docs/requirements/traceability-matrix.md`, in the initial repository skeleton (commit `c8da046`); deleted in commit `3d114fa`; restored from history on 2026-09-16 into `docs/`. Paths inside follow the repository layout of that time; the current layout is in the root `README.md`. The BR numbers are used in this file only.

> **Purpose**: Trace each requirement across the entire development lifecycle — from the strategic process model, through the operational BPMN, down to the actual implementation. This is a **grading criterion** (BPM&EA Task 3).
>
> **Status Legend**:
> - ✅ **Supported** — The requirement is fully addressed in this deliverable
> - ⚠️ **Partial** — Partially addressed; limitations documented in Notes
> - ❌ **Unsupported** — Not addressed; justify why and how it will be handled in a later release
